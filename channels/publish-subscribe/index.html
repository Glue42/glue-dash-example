        <h3>Publish and Subscribe Channels</h3>
        <p>
            Python Dash applications integrated with Glue42. Once multiple applications are on the same channel, they
            can
            communicate by publishing and subscribing data to the channel. This is achieved through the shared context
            data
            object that the applications monitor.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the two applications are on the same channel, Application B can publish data that is received and
            logged by
            Application A if it has subscribed for updates of the current channel. Note that if the applications are not
            on the same channel the applications will not exchange any data.
        </p>
