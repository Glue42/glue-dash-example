        <h3>Correlating an Invocation with a Result</h3>
        <p>
            Python Dash applications integrated with Glue42. The applications demonstrate how to assign a unique
            invocation
            ID and to make a correlation between a returned result and some data stored when the method is called
            (sharing
            data between the callback that triggers the invocation and the callback that handles the returned result).
        </p>

        <p>
            On load, Application B registers a method called "Sum", which accepts parameters (two numbers), calculates
            their
            total and returns the result. Click the "Sum" button in Application A to invoke this method and print the
            result
            from invocation.
        </p>
        <p>
            When invoking the method, Application A sets a unique invocation ID and uses dcc.Store component to share
            the
            start time of invocation with the callback that handles the returned result. When the "Sum" returns, along
            with
            the result the handler callback also receives the invocation ID. As a result, we get the start time of
            invocation from dcc.Store and calculate the elapsed time for execution.
