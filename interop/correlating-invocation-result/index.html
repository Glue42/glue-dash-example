    <h3>Correlating an Invocation with a Result</h3>
    <p>
        Python Dash applications integrated with Glue42. The applications demonstrate how to assign a unique invocation
        ID and to make a correlation between a returned result and some data stored when the method is called (sharing
        data between the callback that triggers the invocation and the callback that handles the returned result).
    </p>

    <p>
        On load, Application B registers a method called "Sum", which accepts parameters (two numbers), calculates their
        total and returns the result. Click the "Sum" button in Application A to invoke this method and print the result
        from invocation.
    </p>
    <p>
        When invoking the method, Application A sets a unique invocation ID and uses dcc.Store component to share the
        start time of invocation with the callback that handles the returned result. When the "Sum" returns, along with
        the result the handler callback also receives the invocation ID. As a result, we get the start time of
        invocation from dcc.Store and calculate the elapsed time for execution.
