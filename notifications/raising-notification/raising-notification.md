## Raising Notification

Python Dash application integrated with Glue42. The application demonstrates how to raise notifications. When the application runs in a browser (Glue42 Core) then a browser notification appears. When the application runs in Glue42 Enterprise then a Glue42 Notification appears.

Use the input fields to assign a title and body to the notification. Click "Raise Notification" button to raise a new notification.

Checkout the source code in `app.py` for details.
