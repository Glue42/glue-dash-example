## Discovering and Navigating Channels

Python Dash application integrated with Glue42. The application demonstrates how to navigate through the available channels. An application can be part of only one channel at a time. The example application also demonstrates how to get the context (name, meta, data) of the current channel.
    
Use the dropdown to leave the current channel or select a new one. The background color of the dropdown reflects the color of the current channel.
